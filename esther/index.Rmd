<span style="color:black"> Esther G is our little queen. She's an aspring competitve eater by day and stuffed animal snuggler by night. She is a pro at making her mom laugh and she's already learned how to keep her dad wrapped around her finger. Esther is brave, adventurous, and independent. She started walking this month and there's no stopping her now. She is one cute handful and we love her! </span>

<span style="color:black"> Esther was diagnosed with Dravet Syndrome ealier this year. Over the past few months Grace and I have been navigating this scary and unfamiliar territory in hopes of learning as much as we can about this rare syndrome and how it will impact Esther and our familiy. We pray and hope for the best and thank each of you for your love, prayers, and support of our little family.  </span>
